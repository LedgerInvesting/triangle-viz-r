# Triangle Visualizations in R

This repo contains examples of the visualizations shown at the "Richer Loss Development Visualizations" presentation at the 2025 CAS Spring Meeting in Toronto.

Most of the visualizations will be added soon to the [Bermuda open-source package](https://github.com/LedgerInvesting/bermuda-ledger) for manipulating loss triangles.
